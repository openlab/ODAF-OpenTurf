ODAF OpenTurf
========

[OpenTurf](http://openturf.cloudapp.net/) is an open-source mapping application for multiple web & mobile platform that enables citizen interaction with Point-of-Interest data. It is an update to the [Open Data Application Framework (ODAF) project](http://odaf.codeplex.com/), used to create [VanGuide web](http://vanguide.cloudapp.net/) & mobile applications ([iPhone](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vanguide/id359020751?mt=8), [Windows Phone 7](http://vanguidewp7.codeplex.com/)).

OpenTurf  can "mash up" location-aware open data sets in KML format. A key feature of OpenTurf is that it enables **social sharing and commenting** that makes the data interactive. This way a government organization can share data & gather feedback on specific data points.
Citizens can:


* Visualize multiple datasets in one centralized location
* **Rate, comment & tag** individual data points in multiple datasets
* Upload your own data points (mash up your data with other datasets)
* Interact with visual points as well as boundary (polygon) information

This application is available as Silverlight web application, iPhone, iPad and Windows Phone 7, 
Check out a [live demo](http://openturf.cloudapp.net), download the code or install using Open Data Installer.
